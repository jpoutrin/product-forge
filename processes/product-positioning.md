# Product Positioning and Branding Process

This process establishes the foundational positioning and brand identity for your product. **This should always be the first step before any product development work.**

## 🎯 Overview

Product positioning and branding forms the cornerstone of all product decisions. It defines:
- **What** your product is (simple, clear definition)
- **Why** it matters (benefits and emotional connection)
- **Who** it is (personality and character)
- **How** it changes the world (long-term vision)

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Interactive Positioning Session

**This is an interactive process. I'll ask each question, analyze your response, and provide expert feedback before moving forward.**

### Core Positioning (3 questions)

   - 🔍 I'll propose 2-3 stronger alternatives if needed

2. **What are your product benefits?**

## 💡 Expert Insights & Frameworks

### My 20-Year Tested Positioning Principles

1. **The Rule of One**: Own one word in the customer's mind
   - Volvo = Safety
   - Google = Search
   - What's your one word?

2. **The Enemy Test**: Great positioning needs a clear enemy
   - Apple vs. IBM ("Think Different")
   - Pepsi vs. Coke ("Choice of a New Generation")
   - Who/what are you against?

3. **The Dinner Party Test**: Would someone excitedly tell friends?
   - Boring: "It's a productivity app"
   - Exciting: "It reads your mind and does your work"

4. **The Value Multiplier**: Benefits should feel 10x the price
   - Calculate real value delivered
   - Compare to alternatives
   - Price at 10-20% of value created

### Red Flags I'll Watch For

⚠️ **Positioning Weaknesses**:
- "We're like Uber for..." (lazy positioning)
- "AI-powered" without clear benefit
- Multiple target audiences (unfocused)
- Benefits that sound like features
- Vision that's just market size

⚠️ **Brand Weaknesses**:
- Personality that doesn't match product experience
- Emotional benefits that feel forced
- Features that don't ladder to benefits
- Universe-denting claims without credibility

### My Improvement Methodology

1. **The Zoom Out**: Start with the biggest possible vision
2. **The Zoom In**: Focus on the most specific benefit
3. **The Stress Test**: Attack from every angle
4. **The Simplify**: Remove every unnecessary word
5. **The Amplify**: Make the bold claim bolder
