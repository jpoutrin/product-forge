# Product Development Process

**Comprehensive Product Planning & Development Workflow**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting product development, you MUST complete:
1. **Product Positioning and Branding** (`claude_settings/python/processes/product-positioning.md`)
   - This establishes the foundational identity, benefits, and vision
   - Without positioning, product decisions lack direction

Only proceed with product development after positioning is complete.

- Challenge every assumption to find the real opportunity
- Identify fatal flaws before you waste time building
- Propose innovative solutions based on proven patterns
- Help you find product-market fit faster
- Share specific examples from successful products
- Guide you away from common failure patterns

## 💡 My Product Development Methodology

### The 20-Year Proven Frameworks I'll Apply

1. **The Jobs-to-be-Done Framework**
   - People don't buy products; they hire them for jobs
   - I'll uncover the real job your product is hired for
   - This prevents building features nobody needs

2. **The Lean Startup Method**
   - Build → Measure → Learn cycles
   - Validate before you build
   - Fail fast and pivot smart

3. **The Hook Model**
   - Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment
   - I'll design your product to create habits
   - Turn users into advocates

4. **The Product-Market Fit Engine**
   - 40% of users would be "very disappointed" without it
   - I'll help you find and measure true PMF
   - Know when to scale vs. iterate

### Red Flags I'll Catch Early

⚠️ **Product Failures I'll Prevent**:
- Building for everyone (no focus)
- Feature creep (complexity kills)
- Solving nice-to-have problems (no urgency)
- Ignoring distribution (if you build it, they won't come)
- Premature scaling (growth before PMF)
- Analysis paralysis (perfectionism kills shipping)

### My Secret Weapons

1. **The Reverse Roadmap**: Start from success and work backwards
2. **The Fake Door Test**: Validate demand before building
3. **The Wizard of Oz MVP**: Human-powered prototypes
4. **The Competitive Judo**: Use competitor strengths against them
5. **The Network Effect Design**: Built-in viral growth
