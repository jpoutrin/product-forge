Analyze these user messages from a Claude Code session. Extract GENERALIZABLE and ADDRESSABLE feedback for improving the Product Forge toolkit.

USER MESSAGES:
"""
{messages}
"""

CRITICAL RULES:
1. GENERALIZE project-specific requests into reusable patterns
   - BAD: "generate consent screen demo page" (too specific)
   - GOOD: "Demo page generator - create static preview pages from designs for layout validation"

2. Extract the UNDERLYING NEED, not the literal request
   - BAD: "fix the login bug in my app"
   - GOOD: "Auth flow debugging skill - diagnose common authentication issues"

3. Only include ADDRESSABLE items that Product Forge could implement
   - Skip project-specific bugs, one-off tasks, or domain-specific features
   - Focus on patterns, workflows, and tools that help ANY developer

4. Give DESCRIPTIVE titles (never "User Suggestion" or "User Request")

Look for:
1. Corrections ("no, use X", "that's wrong") → reveals best practices
2. Preferences ("always", "never", "prefer") → coding style patterns
3. Repeated frustrations → missing skills or workflows
4. Novel approaches → potential new patterns
5. Tool requests → command or skill ideas

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):
{{"feedback": [
  {{"type": "improvement|skill-idea|command-idea|bug-report|pattern", "title": "Descriptive 3-7 word title", "description": "Generalized description of the underlying need and how it could help any developer", "target": "plugin/component if applicable"}}
]}}

If nothing generalizable found, respond: {{"feedback": []}}
